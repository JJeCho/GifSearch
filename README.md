# GifSearch
This application does a simple ajax call to the giphy API when a button with an animal name is clicked. 
It retrieves 10 gifs and displays them on the screen

There are 5 preset buttons with animal names that the user can click.

## Adding a Button
The user also has the option of adding a new button by typing an animal name into the textfield and submitting the name.
The name is then displayed on top with all of the other animal names and can then be clicked to display gifs.
